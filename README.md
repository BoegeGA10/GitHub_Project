This is my repository for **MAGD 150-02 spring 2021**

Within my repository in the _gh-pages_ is three files I have worked on over the course of this semester.
* The first one is called _Lab Assignment One_, in this file it shows how to work with shapes in p5.js for a beginner programmer. Creating these shapes is very easy to write and very manageable to learn without difficulty.
* The second one is called _Lab Assignment 7_, in this file it shows how to work with arrays and for looping in p5.js. Learning how to work with arrays and for looping is more of a challenging task, but if one takes their time learning how to use and write them, should still be an easy and fun task to take on.
* Lastly the third one is called _Lab Assignment 8_, in this file it shows how to work with importing external images and text in p5.js. This is another easy task to take on if one takes the time to read up on how to perform the correct lines of code, and is quite a fun task to do as well!

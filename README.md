* The first one is called _Lab Assignment One_, in this file it shows how to work with shapes in p5.js for a beginner programmer.
* The second one is called _Lab Assignment 7_, in this file it shows how to work with arrays and looping in p5.js.
* Lastly the third one is called _Lab Assignment 8_, in this file it shows how to work with importing external images and text in p5.js.
